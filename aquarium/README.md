# aquarium

ok, so this baisically prints randomly generated fish moving from left to right across the terminal. It's all text based.

This is intended as a little excersise to ease me into object orientation, which I still don't really get.

Currently it doesn't work, I have no clue why

This was done in pycharm if you were wondering what all the venv and \_\_pycache__ was about.
