# aquarium

ok, so this baisically prints randomly generated fish moving across the terminal. It's all text based.

There are also bubbles, and an optional player controlled fish. The waves move, and it is cross platform, because it doesn't depend on msvcrt (\*cough\* \*cough\*).

This is intended as a little excersise to ease me into object orientation, which I still don't really get.
